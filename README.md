📌 Project: Real-Time Finger Counting System using OpenCV & MediaPipe
🖥️ Finger Counting System (OpenCV + MediaPipe)

This project is a real-time finger-count detection system built using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
It uses computer vision and hand landmarks to identify and count the number of fingers shown in front of the camera.

🚀 Features

✔️ Real-time hand tracking

✔️ Detects up to 1 hand

✔️ Counts fingers using landmark logic

✔️ Smooth and fast performance

✔️ Easy to run on any system

📸 Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV

MediaPipe

🧠 How It Works

MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks

Thumb is checked using x-coordinates

Other fingers are checked using y-coordinates

Total raised fingers are counted and displayed
